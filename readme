To run the application you will need to have both Python (with Flask, PyMySQL, etc) and SQL installed in your machine.

Then, you need to open your shell and navigate to the sql folder inside the bdproj2 or open MySQLWorkbench and work from there, access your MySQL instance, and use db.sql as a source by typing 'source db.sql;'.

From there, start by editing the db.py inside the bdproj2 folder and insert the credentials so that the app can access your MySQL instance.

After you have everything setup, you are good to go!

Just type in python3 server.py, open your favorite browser, type in the address chosen on server.py and voil√†.
